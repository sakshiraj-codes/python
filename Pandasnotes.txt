Pandas Data Structure

1. Pandas has two types of data structures:
	a. Series: It's a one dimensional array with indexes, it stores a single column or row of data in a Dataframe.
	b. Dataframe: It's a tabular spreadsheet like structure representing rows each of which contains one or multiple columns.
2. A one-dimensional array(labeled) capable of holding any type of data - Series
3. A two-dimensional data(labeled) structured with columns of potentially different types of data - DataFrame
4. Series is like a column, a DataFrame is the whole table.
